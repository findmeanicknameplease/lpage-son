327
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,914
Care for a glass,

328
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,875
Mr. Passenger?

329
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,169
Call me Red.

330
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,880
I'm still getting used to
the "Dark Passenger" thing.

331
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,131
Yes.

332
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:37,426
The press's fixation
with nicknames is absurd.

333
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,887
"Lady Vengeance"?

334
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,765
If I were a guy, I wouldn't
be "Sir Vengeance."

335
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,188
Grab a couple.

336
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:59,198
<i>This is getting
better and better.</i>

337
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,581
The man loves liberty, huh?

338
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,999
Prater somehow got his hands on

339
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,585
Frédéric Auguste
Bartholdi's original model.

340
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,963
Showy as fuck, yeah?
But it's not about

341
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,548
freedom or liberty.

342
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,591
Prater likes to own things.

343
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,760
And people.

344
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,309
To rich people

345
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,770
and the wine they collect.

346
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,445
You're drinking it wrong.

347
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:41,282
Didn't know there was a
right way to drink something.

348
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,784
Well, first of all,
did you like it?

349
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,328
It was fine.

350
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,583
The key to enjoying wine

351
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,293
is understanding it.

352
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,752
The glass you're drinking

353
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,130
was bottled while
Mark Twain was alive.

354
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:59,216
Its very existence is a miracle.

355
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,010
-Huh.
-Now,

356
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,012
try again,

357
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,638
but take your time.

358
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,647
Well, what do you think?

359
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,857
It's pretty tasty.

360
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,526
Better be. Bottle
cost 4,000 bucks.

361
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:23,198
So, master sommelier by day,

362
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,825
Lady Vengeance by night?

363
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,869
I'm a real Renaissance woman.

364
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,664
Oh, you scored a goal?

365
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,749
Oh, that's great, sweetie.

366
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,376
Okay, listen, I got to go,

367
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,378
so to love you and
Mom, okay? All right.

368
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,338

369

Aw. Babies that cute

390
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,256
make me wish I had one.
But then I remember that

391
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,799
-they shit their pants, so...
-Yeah.

392
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,092
They do shit a lot, yeah.

393
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,177
So, how do you
have space for both

394
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,470
family and... this?

395
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:27,930
I got to admit, I feel guilty

396
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,598
when I leave, but these
little business trips

397

00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:10,360
not your punishment.

489
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:17,367
The Canton Clubber's bat
will join my collection.

490
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:22,205
As he no longer
has any use for it.

491
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:29,296
<i>Huh. So, this buffet
can bite back.</i>

492
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,048
But on the bright side,

493
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,925
we still have

494
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,093
so much to be thankful for.

495
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:37,387
Welcome, Red.

496
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,599
We're so grateful
to have you here.

497
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,352
To new friends.

498
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:46,063
To new friends.

500
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:52,110
Thank you for letting me in.

501
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,366
All right, let's eat before
these get... get cold.

502
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:00,410
I guess we, uh,
each just take one?

503
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,787
-Stern, or...
-Okay.

504
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:06,792
Would you like some salad?

505
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,135
-Oh, rosemary.
-Mmm, mmm, mmm.

506
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,923
Pan-seared cauliflower.

507
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:16,176
With Japanese turnip medallions

508
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,429
in a sweet potato puree.

509
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,014
Charley found the vegan products

510
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:23,266
and cookbooks in your apartment.

511
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,143
-Oh.
-Good news.

512
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:27,520
There's more where
that came from.

513
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,149
I'm glad I didn't have lunch.

514
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:32,818
These are prime
for sure, no doubt.

515
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,292
What's happening?

516
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,711
Time for the highlight
of the evening.

517
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,171
Take it away, Lowell.

518
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:55,507
Let's show and tell, baby.

519
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,302
So I wanted to try something new

520
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,304
this go-around, something fun.

521
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,055
So I've put together
a little multimedia

522
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:03,390
presentation for y'all.

523

permission to light
myself on fire.

527
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:13,483
So tonight I'm
letting you all in

528
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,026
on my process.

529
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,404
As most of you know,
I've always had

530
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,823
a deep connection to tattoos.

531
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,241
Yeah, he does.

532
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:22,826
And lately,

533
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,452
this artist has been

534
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:27,497
doing some real
interesting work.

535
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:29,124
See, it's about

536
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,792
the right piece

537
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,919

decided to get some new ink

I feel the pressure rise,

your first night, but, uh,

584
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,084
the money with your invitation

585
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,794
was an advance for
a show and tell.

586

I hope you'll feel
comfortable sharing next time.

Of course.

Angel Batista.

How is she?

603
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,470
Well, she finally
finished her PhD.

604
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,972

school principal now.

615
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:58,166
Went through a lot together.

00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,543
-Like what?
-He was the witness

617
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:00,919
at my wedding.

618
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:03,504
My ex, María, also
worked at the station,

619
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,715
so we had to do it on the QT

620
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,717
to protect our jobs.

Yeah, that-that sounds like him.

624
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,019
Your dad is actually the reason

625
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,730

a few weeks ago.

626

00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,210
I went up there to find my dad.

633
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,545
Hadn't seen him in years.

634
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:49,133
Turns out he wasn't
the dad I needed.

blew up, I split.

-With your dad?
-With yours.

639

I'm not running into
you by chance, am I?

640
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:12,282
Did Dexter ever share anything
about his past with you?

641
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,575
About why he left Miami?

642
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,244
I should probably
get back to work.

643
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,914
My ex-wife had this theory.

Nothing you say can hurt him.

654
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,316
I don't know what
you're talking about.

655
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,483
Please.

656
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:49,944
I need the closure.

657
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,990
I wish I could help.

658
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:55,158
Good luck.

659
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,993
I'm in the city a few more days

660
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,620
if you want to talk.

661
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:11,466
Still got to work on that
customer service face.

662
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:23,311
Excuse me, but if you
think Harrison had

663
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,229
anything to do
with that murder...

664
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:27,982
What murder?

665
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,442
Ryan Foster.

666
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:31,110
He stayed here.

667
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,738
The-the guy who was found
chopped up in garbage bags

668
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,531
by the trash docks.

669
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,660
Ah, if I could get
this thing to work.

670
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:42,622
And it's sideways, there
we go, there she is.

671
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:43,915
Mm.

672
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:46,417
Yep, yep, we had our sweet

673
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:49,128
angel Mabel,

674
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,381
sweet angel, last July.

675
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,633
Yeah, it's been a gift each day.

676
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:54,926
Caught you.

677
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,261
Sorry, I was just, um...

678
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,222
Internet-stalking me?

679
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,556
It's cool.

680
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,725
I tried looking you up as well.

681
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:03,976
You did?

682
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,645
Didn't find anything.

683
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:06,813
So mysterious.

684
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,022
It's annoying, right?

685
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,149
Very.

686
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,984
Top me off,

687
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,111
Ms. Sum-ah-lee-air?

688
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,366
Perfect.

689
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:23,579
Ooh, someone got new ink.

690
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,083
I'm not one of your
pervy art pieces.

691
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:30,962
Okay, okay. Okay, okay.

692
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,423
Careful with this one, Red.

693
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,508
I... That's why I take my
anger out for a drive...

694
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:39,262
Lowell needs to learn
about boundaries.

695
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:42,098
You're an effective teacher.

696
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,226
So...

697
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:49,147
...what is your origin story?

698
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,399
Let me guess.

699
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,442
Terrible mother?

700
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,653
I actually had a great mom.

701
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,530
Interesting.

702
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,700
I assumed mommy issues
were a given in this crew.

703
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,204
Take one guess how Al's
mother wore her hair.

704
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,246
How many is that for you?

705
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,664
-Glasses?
-Yeah.

706
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,333
-Four.
-I count six.

707
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,792
I'm not immune to mommy issues.

708
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:12,628
Mine just come from
how I lost her.

709
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:18,551
What is all this?

710
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:21,346
You mean, besides the
money and the bougie wine?

711
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,806
What is Prater
getting out of it?

712
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,185
How about we talk tomorrow?

713
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:28,477
Just the two of us?

714
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,021
I could do that.

715
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:32,524
Phones so you can

716
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:35,193
communicate with the group
over the next two weeks.

717
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,486
-Hat.
-Thank you.

718
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:38,613
Thank you, everyone,

719
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,531
for joining me this evening.

720
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,117
It's been lovely catching up.

721
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,912
Charley will be in touch
regarding our next gathering.

722
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,872
And in the meantime,

723
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:49,374
go and enjoy the city.

724
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,125
It has so much to offer.

725
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,086
Hey, you know what, I'm gonna
start a group chat so we can,

726
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,088
uh, stay in touch,
maybe, maybe get a tour

727
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,131
of Ellis Island or
something, huh? Yeah.

728
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,299
Sound good?

729
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,551
Thank you.

730
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,010
See you.

731
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:04,722
It was nice meeting you.

732
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,683
Text me.

733
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,895
By next meeting, a trophy.

734
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,651
Bye.

735
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:23,616
Uh... thank you.

736
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,076
For everything.

737
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,911
I...

738
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:29,080
said things tonight that
I've never been able

739
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,957
to express out loud before.

740
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,917
Well, that's what these
gatherings are for.

741
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,086
So people like you
know you're not alone.

742
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:37,713
I didn't realize it
was something I needed.

743
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:40,592
There's a lot of power
in sharing your story.

744
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,678
Just wait for your
show-and-tell.

745
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,972
Yeah, about that.

746
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:48,600
Do I need to make a
whole presentation?

747
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,894
Oh, no, nothing so elaborate.

748
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:54,230
We just want to know
the real Dark Passenger.

749
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,565
That raw animal
aggression it takes

750
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:59,443
to saw another man's head off.

751
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:04,282
Right.

752
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:09,287
I'm sure you'll come up
with something great.

753
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,455
Looking forward to it.

754
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:26,012
That went exceptionally
well, don't you think?

755
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,472

00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,782
-Actually, make it two.
-Mm-hmm.

762
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,746

-Enjoy.

You were too busy
being out with yours.

818
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,173
Give me a break.

819
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:33,008
The last time I was at a
dinner party was at my wedding.

820
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:36,554
I can't take care of my son if
I don't take care of myself.

821
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:39,932
So now you're getting life
advice from ponytail trophy guy?

822
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,976
Dex, if you want
real connection,

823
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,270
that's where you
should be looking.

824
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,063
Yeah, I tried.

825
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:47,898
He shot me.

826
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,151
Never thought I'd
get another chance

827
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:53,070
to be open with
someone like that.

828
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:54,905
Until last night.

829
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,825
Those aren't your friends.

830
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,785
They're supposed
to be your victims.

831
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:02,204
I'm gonna do it, Dad, I'm
just being smart about it.

832
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:03,956
Smart or stalling

833
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,291
because you like these people?

834
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,084
If they start
disappearing one by one,

835
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:09,420
how's that gonna
look for the new guy?

836
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,215
Best to wait until
the meetings are over.

837
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,258
That works fine for
most of your new pals.

838
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,135
But explain that to the
woman who's gonna get

839
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:17,553
her arm de-sleeved

840
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,138
before Lowell leaves town.

841
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,806
-That is a complication.
-Yeah.

842
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:23,017
And so is your date
with Lady Vengeance.

843
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,768
It's not a date, it's a...

844
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,062
fact-finding mission.

845
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:31,442
I haven't forgotten
why I'm here.

846
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,448
<i>The fuck?</i>

847
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:38,950
<i>It's not even 11.</i>

848
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,535
Uh, sorry, I forgot
you're on vacation.

849
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:44,038
Would you maybe want
to meet up sometime?

850
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,415
Would love to hear
more about your...

851
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,708
skins.

852
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,418
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

853
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:50,962
<i>I'm not much of a day guy,</i>

854
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,422
<i>-so can we say happy hour?</i>
-Perfect.

855
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:55,145
Just text me where to...

856
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,969
See?

857
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:01,597
And I still have
time to fit in a jog.

858
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:06,644
So, you run every day?

859
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,020
Got to stay in shape.

860
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,647
Not all of us get
to do our thing

861
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:12,149
by sitting in the
backseat of a car.

862
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:14,652
So, when's a good time
to talk about Prater?

863
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,320
Fire away.

864
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:17,613
I'll answer any questions

865
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:19,824
for as long as you can keep up.

866
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,660
How many of Prater's
gatherings have you been to?

867
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,620
This is my fourth year.

868
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,664
But they started a
few years before that.

869
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,708
Four years? You must enjoy it.

870
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:31,252
I enjoy the money.

871
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,754
Is Prater really just a fan?

872
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,798
I mean, the guy's a voyeur.

873
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:37,216
He's a vampire.

874
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,677
He wants all the dirty details.

875
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:42,846
But, no, I don't think he's
actually a killer himself.

876
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:44,473
Do you want a water?

877
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,225
I want a water.

878
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,351
Two waters.

879
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:48,977
Six dollars.

880
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:49,979
Thanks.

881
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,062
Thank you.

882
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,690
And there's really no catch?

883
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:56,152
As long as you don't
break any of his rules.

884
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,403
Mm.

885
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:59,530
So, breaking rules.

886
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,241
Is that what happened
with that Keith guy

887
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:04,452
-Prater was talking about?
-Yep.

888
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:07,371
It appears the Canton Clubber

889
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:08,789
is no more.

890
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:11,208
That happen often,
people breaking rules?

891
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:13,210
Well, not everybody
gets invited back,

892
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:14,878
if that's what you're asking.

893
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:17,048
One guy got uninvited.

894
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,674
Another got arrested.

895
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,926
And then his first
night in jail,

896
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,970
he committed suicide.

897
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:25,097
Allegedly.

898
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,352
So...

899
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,729
where'd you grow up?

900
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:36,567
All over.

901
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,237
Mom was always looking
for something new.

902
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:41,739
Someone new.

903
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:44,200
The longest stay was in Tulsa.

904
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,909
Mm.

905
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:47,286
I drove through there once.

906
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:50,498
Then you know there's
shit-all to do.

907
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:53,041
Not that I gave it a chance.

908
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:57,004
I was a loner.

909
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:01,091
Other than my
younger sister Hazel.

910
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:04,261
She was an angel.

911
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:06,055
I...

912
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:07,807
was...

913
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,391
not.

914
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:12,811
When did you know you were...

915
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:17,191
...different?

916
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:20,319
Always.

917
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:23,697
In the first grade there
was this bowl-cut kid

918
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:25,157
who annoyed me,

919
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,576
so I hit him in the head
with my library book

920
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:30,579
and I stuck thumbtacks
into his face.

921
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:33,332
If I had normal parents
who believed in therapy,

922
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:35,126
maybe I would have
been diagnosed

923
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:37,544
with some fancy
personality disorder.

924
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:41,048
Instead, they told me to "stop
being so angry all the time."

925
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:46,678
I almost stabbed a kid on
a basketball court once.

926
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:49,640
My dad stopped me.

927
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,686
He tried to help.

928
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,979
Best he could.

929
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:03,278
When I was 15, I found ballet.

930
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:05,572
It is a punishing practice.

931
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:08,659
Gave me a release for
all that pent-up rage.

932
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,035
And I was good enough

933
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:13,330
that I got into a dance
academy out of town.

934
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:16,124
Away from my mother's
new boyfriend.

935
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:19,837
The way that creep looked at me.

936
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:22,631
But you got out of there.

937
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:24,675
I did.

938
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,262
Hazel didn't.

939
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,807
I thought she was too young.

940
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,893
And when I came
back for the summer,

941
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,479
I found out.

942
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,481
And I killed the guy.

943
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:42,025
And I got to tell you.

944
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:45,487
Much better release
than the ballet.

945
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:50,701
I'll never forget how
my first time felt.

946
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:56,707
Like a path had finally
opened up for me.

947
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,129
Are you hungry?

948
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,882
-Always.
-My Airbnb is a few blocks away.

949
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,509
Do you want to come over?

950
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,470
I'd love to, but...

951
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:12,556
Come on.

952
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,058
I have incredible pastries.

953
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:18,729
And I love a good reward
after the end of a run.

954
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:40,083
Oh, this is the vegan one.

955
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,752
It's kale.

956
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:44,796
Thanks for remembering.

957
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:00,437
Did this come with the place?

958
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:04,024
See for yourself.

959
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:06,944
♪ Intriguing music ♪

960
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:21,500
Is this...

961
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:23,585
My collection.

962
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:31,176
I can still remember
all of their faces.

963
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:33,888
The look in their eyes
right before I killed them.

964
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,141
It's nice.

965
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:41,645
Being able to remember.

966
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:47,610
I...

967
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:50,278
I'm gonna take a quick shower.

968
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:51,864
Okay.

969
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:55,117
There's an Italian espresso
maker in the kitchen.

970
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,203
Help yourself.

971
00:49:58,286 --> 00:50:00,164
Okay.

972
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:26,023
Showering with a serial killer?

973
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:30,402
Not exactly part of the Code.

974
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:33,739
Remember happy hour with Lowell.

975
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:38,369
Uh, something just came up.

976
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,203
What?

977
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:43,874
Thanks for the run.

978
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:55,719
Hey.

979
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:57,220
Sorry I'm late.

980
00:50:58,013 --> 00:50:59,556
Next round's on me.

981
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:01,058
-What are you drinking?
-Yo, can I take a rain check?

982
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:01,934
I kinda got to...

983
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:04,227
-get ready.
-For what?

984
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:08,732
I thought it'd take

985
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:12,277
more sessions, but her
pain tolerance is crazy.

986
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:13,820

987
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:14,780
Yep.

988

991
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:27,250
My day job's anesthesiology.

992
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:29,920
But it helps in
my nightlife, too.

993
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,424
My next piece will be ready

994
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:34,800
in about two hours.

995
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:37,219

walking back to her place

01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:29,185
Came in one piece, left in nine.

1145
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:32,313
Yeah, I saw that
guy on the news.

1146
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:34,357
Funny thing is...

1147
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,860
that's exactly the way the
Bay Harbor Butcher did it.

1148
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:42,198
I really hope they
catch that guy.

1149
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:45,535
I spoke to the lead on the
case, Detective Wallace.

1150
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:47,787
She said the cleanup
of the suspected

1151
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:49,456
murder site was impeccable.

1152
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:51,916
Almost as if the
culprit was an expert.

1153
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:55,211
Or learned from one.

1154
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:57,213
That sounds crazy.

1155
01:01:57,338 --> 01:01:59,215
Less crazy if you know the son

1156
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:00,717
of a notorious serial killer

1157
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:03,302
was at the same
hotel that night.

1158
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:07,390
I didn't mention
anything about you yet.

1159
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:08,933
And I don't have to.

1160
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:12,062
I'm just looking
for confirmation.

1161
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:14,230
About Dexter.

1162
01:02:15,022 --> 01:02:16,608
I already told you.

1163
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:18,359
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1164
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:20,361
Honestly, that guy Ryan

1165
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:22,155
sounded like a real asshole.

1166
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:23,656
Good riddance.

1167
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:25,241
Did your dad make it seem

1168
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:27,118
like that's all he was doing?

1169
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:29,579
Taking out the worst criminals?

1170
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:32,290
Making the world a better place?

1171
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:35,085
Like he was some
sort of Dark Avenger?

1172
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:37,420
A lot of innocent people died

1173
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:38,755
because of your dad.

1174
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,465
People that I loved.

1175
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:43,176
My ex-wife María
LaGuerta, your Aunt Deb,

1176
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:44,802
your mother.

1177
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:52,935
Sounds like you've gone down a
real conspiratorial rabbit hole.

1178
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:56,147
Good luck getting out of it.

1179
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:57,940
We're done here.

1180
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:02,695
This is a dark path
you're going down.

1181
01:03:05,406 --> 01:03:08,618
I truly hope you don't
become like your dad.
